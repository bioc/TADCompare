Description: 
    TADCompare is an R package designed to identify and characterize differential Topologically Associated 
    Domains (TADs) between multiple Hi-C contact matrices. It contains 
    functions for finding differential TADs between two datasets, finding
    differential TADs over time and identifying consensus TADs across multiple
    matrices. It takes all of the main types of HiC input and returns simple,
    comprehensive, easy to analyze results.
